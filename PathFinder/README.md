# PathFinder
PathFinder is a Graph Visualizing Algorithm I built using Javascript. The User is allowed to place the Start and End Points, as well as any obstructions on the Map, the App then renders the Shortest Path in realtime using the Algorithm that the User selects.

The Live Demo may be viewed here [PathFinder Demo](https://kartikx.github.io/PathFinder/)

You may also view a short 1 minute video [here](https://imgur.com/a/ao5O1fE) to understand how to use the basic functionality.

This project was inspired (but not copied) by a similar project by [Clement Mihailescu](https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Pathfinding-Visualizer).
